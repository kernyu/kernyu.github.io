From South Korea. Currently in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Committed to the field of Biology, from a data science persepctive. Some of my favorite pastime is watching this [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@samdaejang_official). My hobby is lifting heavy things, and I competed as a powerlifter in [USAPL](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/kernyupark).
