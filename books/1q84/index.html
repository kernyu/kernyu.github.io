I wasnâ€™t into Japanese fictions then, but while talking with a post-doc at Penn while on a day trip at New York, I had an impulse buy. I read well into the book until I lost interest again, but it was indeed captivating. I enjoy and miss the subtle emotional changes and imagining myself being there while reading fiction books. I will commit myself to finishing it and providing a well-rounded review.</p> </body></html>
